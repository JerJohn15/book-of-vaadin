For the most current version, please see the on-line edition available at <uri>http://vaadin.com/book</uri>. You can also find PDF and EPUB versions of the book there. You may find the other versions more easily searchable than the printed book. The index in the book is incomplete and will be expanded later. The web edition also has some additional technical content, such as some example code and additional sections that you may need when actually doing development. The purpose of the slightly abridged print edition is more to be an introductionary textbook to Vaadin, and still fit in your pocket."
